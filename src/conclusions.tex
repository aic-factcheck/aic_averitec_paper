\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\todo{write - we have shown that RAG paradigm outperforms various established pipelines on the task of automated fact-checking in ope domain.}

\subsection{Future works}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Optimize for open-source LLMs, see if those can be fine-tuned e.g. using LoRa towards a finer result
    \item Integrate a search engine api for use in the wild
    \item Generating evidence in the form of declarative sentences rather than Question-Answer pairs should be 
    \item Re-examine the Likert-scale rating (section~\ref{likert}) to establish a more appropriate and fine-grained means of tokenizing the label probabilities
\end{enumerate}
